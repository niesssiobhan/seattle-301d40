# Class 11: Server-side templating with EJS

## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Daily Plan
